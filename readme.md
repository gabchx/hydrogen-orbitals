### **Code Explanation**

#### **1. Key Components**

- **Radial Wavefunction (`radial`):**

  - Computes the radial part of the hydrogen-like orbital using associated Laguerre polynomials.
  - Normalized using quantum numbers `n` (principal) and `l` (azimuthal).
  - Formula derived from the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen-like atoms.

- **Spherical Harmonics (`sph_harm`):**

  - Represents the angular part of the wavefunction using spherical harmonics.
  - `sph_harm(m, l, phi, theta)` matches the quantum mechanical convention for angular momentum.

- **Wavefunction in Cartesian Coordinates (`wave_func_cart`):**

  - Converts Cartesian coordinates `(x, y, z)` to spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`.
  - Combines radial and angular components to compute the full wavefunction.

- **Orbital Class (`Orbital_3D`):**

  - Initializes a 3D grid of points.
  - Computes the wavefunction and probability density (`prob`).
  - Normalizes the probability to ensure total probability = 1.

- **Transition Class (`Transition_3D`):**
  - Manages animation events (transitions between orbitals or pauses).
  - Interpolates wavefunctions during transitions using a time-dependent linear combination:
    ```python
    psi = c1 * orb1.psi + c2 * orb2.psi  # c1 = cos(angle), c2 = sin(angle)
    ```
  - Renders frames by sampling 3D points according to the probability distribution and plotting them as a scatter plot.

#### **2. Animation Workflow**

1. **Frame Generation:**

   - For each frame, the code checks if it's a `transition` (interpolating between two orbitals) or a `wait` (static orbital).
   - During transitions, the probability density smoothly evolves from the initial to the target orbital.
   - Points are randomly sampled from the probability distribution to visualize the orbital's electron cloud.

2. **Visualization:**
   - **3D Scatter Plot:** Shows the electron density cloud.
   - **2D Cross-Sections:** Display slices through the `xy` and `xz` planes using contour plots.
   - Quantum numbers `(n, l, m)` are displayed dynamically.
